# Eclipse Kuksa 0.1.0
Welcome to Eclipse Kuksa 0.1.0. Eclipse Kuksa consists of multiple parts that cover different aspects of the platform and are each developed in seperate repositories. The parts are:

- In-Vehicle platform: https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/releases
- IDE: https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.ide/releases
- Apps: https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.apps/releases
- Cloud: https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.cloud/releases

You can find the source code releases and more information regarding the different parts in the respective repositories. 

This release archive of Eclipse Kuksa 0.1.0 only contains the binaries, descriptors and further information for the cloud part. We did not include the other parts in this archive because we came to the conlusion that it would be easier to directly work with the source code and build the projects in accordance to the specific use case. For instance, for the In-Vehicle platform we are not able to support multiple different target architectures at this point in time.
